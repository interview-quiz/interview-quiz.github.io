Type Manipulation in TypeScript

Type manipulation refers to techniques in TypeScript that allow us to create new types by transforming existing ones. These techniques are powerful when working with complex data structures and enable developers to write reusable, maintainable, and type-safe code.

Key Concepts in Type Manipulation

1. Mapped Types

Mapped types create new types by transforming properties of an existing type.

type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  isAdmin: boolean;
};

// Create a type with all properties optional
type PartialUser = {
  [K in keyof User]?: User[K];
};

Explanation:

keyof User extracts the keys of User ('id' | 'name' | 'isAdmin').

[K in keyof User] iterates over each key.

User[K] represents the type of each key.


Built-in Utility Example:

type PartialUser = Partial<User>; // Built-in mapped type


---

2. Keyof Operator

keyof extracts the keys of a type as a union of string literals.

type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
};

type UserKeys = keyof User; // 'id' | 'name'

This is useful when you want to create dynamic property access or enforce strict key checks.


---

3. Conditional Types

Conditional types allow defining types based on conditions.

type IsString<T> = T extends string ? true : false;

type A = IsString<string>; // true
type B = IsString<number>; // false

Conditional types are useful for creating type-level logic, such as filtering types or enforcing constraints.


---

4. Infer Keyword

infer is used within conditional types to extract a part of a type.

type ReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : never;

type MyFunction = () => number;
type Result = ReturnType<MyFunction>; // number

Here, infer R extracts the return type of a function.


---

5. Utility Types

TypeScript provides built-in utility types that simplify common type manipulations.

Partial<T>: Makes all properties of T optional.

Required<T>: Makes all properties of T required.

Readonly<T>: Makes all properties of T read-only.

Pick<T, K>: Picks a subset of properties from T.

Omit<T, K>: Omits a subset of properties from T.


type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type UserWithoutEmail = Omit<User, 'email'>;


---

6. Template Literal Types

You can create string literal types using template literals.

type Status = 'loading' | 'success' | 'error';
type StatusMessage = `Status is ${Status}`;

const message: StatusMessage = 'Status is success';


---

7. Recursive Types

Recursive types are types that reference themselves, useful for defining complex structures like trees or nested arrays.

type NestedArray<T> = T | NestedArray<T>[];

const example: NestedArray<number> = [1, [2, [3, 4]], 5];


---

Practical Example: Deep Partial

Let's create a utility type DeepPartial<T> that makes all properties and nested properties optional.

type DeepPartial<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]?: T[K] extends object ? DeepPartial<T[K]> : T[K];
};

type User = {
  id: number;
  profile: {
    name: string;
    address: {
      street: string;
      city: string;
    };
  };
};

type PartialUser = DeepPartial<User>;


---

Use Cases of Type Manipulation

1. Dynamic API Responses: Manipulate API response types based on specific conditions (e.g., partial updates).


2. Form Builders: Create types for form fields dynamically based on the data model.


3. Data Validation: Define strict validation types using conditional types and inference.
