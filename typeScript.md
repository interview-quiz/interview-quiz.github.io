1. Advanced Types

Mapped Types: Creating types by transforming existing ones.

Conditional Types: Using conditions within types (T extends U ? X : Y).

Template Literal Types: Creating types using template literals.

Utility Types: Deep understanding of built-in utility types like Partial, Pick, Omit, Required, Readonly, etc.

Distributive Conditional Types: How conditional types behave when applied to unions.


2. Type Manipulation

Infer Keyword: Extracting types in conditional types.

Key Remapping: Using mapped types with as to remap keys.

Recursive Types: Defining types that recursively reference themselves.


3. Generics (Advanced Usage)

Generic Constraints: Restricting generic types with extends.

Generic Variance: Covariance and contravariance in generics.

Higher-order Generics: Using generics to define higher-order types.


4. Declaration Merging

Combining multiple declarations (interfaces, modules, functions) into a single entity.


5. Module Augmentation

Extending third-party libraries by augmenting their types.


6. Type Narrowing

Advanced narrowing techniques beyond simple type guards (using assertion functions and custom type guards).


7. Symbol and Unique Symbol

Using symbol and unique symbol for defining unique and constant values in types.


8. Type Inference and Type Compatibility

How TypeScript infers types in complex scenarios.

Structural vs nominal typing.


9. Advanced Decorators

Creating advanced class, method, and property decorators in TypeScript.


10. Compiler API

Working with TypeScriptâ€™s Compiler API to create custom tools, linters, or code transformers.


11. Advanced JSX & React Types

Intrinsic element types.

Extending JSX.IntrinsicElements for custom components.

Typing React.forwardRef, React.Context, React.HOC, and hooks.


12. Advanced Configuration & Performance

Custom TypeScript configurations for large codebases (tsconfig.json optimization).

Strict mode options (strict, strictFunctionTypes, strictBindCallApply).

Incremental and project references for faster builds.


13. Advanced Error Handling with Types

Creating exhaustive type checks with never.

Handling complex union and intersection types in error handling.


14. Type-Level Programming

Type Functions: Using types as functions to transform other types.

Type-Level Recursion: Recursive operations on types.

Type-Level Assertions: Ensuring certain type conditions at compile time.


15. Practical Use Cases

Writing a type-safe library.

Building a schema validator using types.

Creating a type-safe form builder.
